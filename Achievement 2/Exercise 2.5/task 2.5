# Recipe App Model Updates Analysis

## Current Model Structure
Our Recipe app currently has three well-structured models:

### Recipe Model
Current attributes:
- name (CharField, max_length=120)
- cooking_time (IntegerField) 
- description (TextField)
- difficulty (CharField, max_length=20)
- ingredients (ManyToManyField)
- category (ForeignKey)

### Proposed Enhancements

Adding new fields to Recipe model:
1. created_at (DateTimeField)
   - Tracks when recipes are added
   - Enables sorting by newest recipes
   - Helps with content management

2. updated_at (DateTimeField) 
   - Monitors recipe modifications
   - Shows latest recipe improvements
   - Useful for version tracking

3. image (ImageField)
   - Displays recipe photos
   - Enhances visual appeal
   - Helps users visualize final results

4. servings (IntegerField)
   - Indicates portion size
   - Assists with ingredient scaling
   - Improves recipe usability

These additions will enhance:
- User experience
- Recipe management
- Content organization
- Visual presentation

The existing Ingredient and Category models remain unchanged as they currently serve their purposes effectively.
