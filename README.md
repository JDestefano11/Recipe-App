## Data Structure Choice

For the `recipe_1` structure, a Python dictionary was chosen because it allows for easy and clear association of keys with their respective values. This makes the data more readable and accessible. Each recipe attribute (name, cooking time, and ingredients) can be quickly accessed and modified using its corresponding key. This structure is efficient and well-suited for representing complex data with multiple attributes.

For the `all_recipes` structure, a Python list was chosen because it allows for sequential storage of multiple recipes. Lists are dynamic and can easily accommodate adding, removing, or updating recipes. This makes it an ideal choice for managing a collection of recipes where order and accessibility are important. Each recipe is stored as a dictionary within the list, providing a clear and organized way to handle recipe data.
