- **What I learned today**:

  - How to define and store recipes using Python dictionaries.
  - How to combine multiple recipes into a list.
  - How to save data to a JSON file using Python.
  - How to run Python scripts from the command prompt.

- **Challenges faced**:

  - Understanding the correct way to run Python scripts from the command prompt.
  - Ensuring the JSON file is correctly formatted and saved.

- **How I overcame them**:
  - Clarified the distinction between running commands in the Python interactive shell and the command prompt.
  - Used Python's `json` module to serialize and save data to a JSON file.

- **What I learned today**:

  - How to create a more complex Python script that handles multiple recipes and ingredients.
  - Implementing a function (take_recipe()) to collect user input for recipes.
  - Using nested loops to process recipes and ingredients.
  - Implementing logic to determine recipe difficulty based on cooking time and number of ingredients.
  - How to create and update a list of unique ingredients across multiple recipes.
  - Sorting and displaying a list of ingredients alphabetically with numbering.

- **Challenges faced**:

  - Structuring a more complex script with multiple functionalities.
  - Implementing the logic to determine recipe difficulty based on multiple criteria.
  - Ensuring that ingredients are not duplicated in the ingredients list.
  - Sorting and displaying the ingredients list in a specific format.

- **How I overcame them**:

  - Broke down the problem into smaller, manageable steps and implemented them one at a time.
  - Used conditional statements (if-elif-else) to implement the difficulty determination logic.
  - Utilized the 'in' operator to check for ingredient existence before adding to the list.
  - Used Python's built-in sorted() function and enumerate() to sort and number the ingredients list.

- **New skills acquired**:

  - Creating more complex, multi-function Python scripts.
  - Handling and processing user input for multiple items.
  - Working with nested data structures (lists of dictionaries).
  - Implementing custom logic for data classification (recipe difficulty).
  - Sorting and formatting output for better readability.
